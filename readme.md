Rebar barcode reverb
====================

Since the dawn of the UNIX epoch, mankind has been using barcodes to solve the
problems of our modern world. Meanwhile, apart from a few examples like overtly
symbolic tattoos, barcodes have been severely underutilized in the realm of
culture and entertainment. Let's take a step in this direction!

This is a proof-of-concept for creating an audio FX app where parameter input is
provided through scanning bar- and QR codes.

This code was written as part of a "personal project" generously funded by my
employer, Allihoopa AB.

Features
--------
* AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer provides camera view and captures metadata from
camera using AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate
* Metadata is mapped to audio FX parameter space
* AVAudioEngine graph consisting of a delay-reverb chain processes incoming audio

Mode of operation
-----------------
Launch app, using some suitable audio setup to avoid mic feedback (headphones
are fine). Aim camera at some barcode:
* Green outline = found a numeric barcode, it's value is used to alter the FX parameters
* Red outline = found a barcode whose value could not be used for parameters
* Brown outline = found a metadata object in the image that is something other than a barcode (point at someone's face to try it out!)
